Removing some anchor tags with duplicate screenshots.

Was browsing the (Orbot Gallery Page)[https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/] and spotted some duplicate photos. Using the inspector function I removed the anchor tags to show what the change would look like for the web page.

There was no repo for the website so I couldn't do a pull request.

Heres what it looked like before:

I circled the duplicates in green.

After removing a couple anchor tags here is what it looked like:
